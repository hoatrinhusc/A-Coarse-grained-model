1. * Make sure you do:
	module load gcc/5.3.0 intel/psxe-2015-64-bit
   * Make sure you have the modified version of Gromacs 2016.4

2. Manually create a box of only one crowder, see file "ficoll.gro"

3. Replicate the box to get many crowders:
	 gmx genconf -f ficoll.gro -o ficoll.box.gro -nbox 10 11 9 -rot
   * Note:
	 You should change -nbox 10 11 9 to whatever number to create the wanted number of crowders.
         For example, the above command will create a box of 10*11*9 = 990 crowders

4. Minimization the box of crowders (See folder "990Ficoll"):
	gmx grompp -f minim.mdp -c ficoll.box.gro -p fi.top -o minim.tpr
	gmx mdrun -v -deffnm minim
   Note about LJ interaction (see file "fi.top"):
	* Factor 4 is coded in Gromacs for LJ interaction with combination rule 2,hence, epsilon is set as 0.6/4=0.15
	* sigma = -2*(55/3.8)*0.1 = -2.8947  
   You might want to modify the fi.top for your crowders. 

5. Minimization the box of crowders and protein (See folder "SOD.CACB.Nocharge.Ficoll"):
   * Copy SOD.top and SOD.ab.pdb from "2.Topology" to "SOD.CACB.Nocharge.Ficoll".
   * After coppying, made 3 changes in SOD.top manually to insert Ficoll topology. Diff SOD.top and SOD.Fi.top to see the changes.
   * cp 990Ficoll/minim.gro SOD.CACB.Nocharge.Ficoll
   * Manually create "fi.itp" to include in SOD.Fi.top
   * After that, use the sequence of commands:
	gmx editconf -f SOD.ab.pdb -o SOD.gro
 	gmx solvate -cp SOD.gro -cs minim.gro -maxsol 990 -box 30 30 30 -o SOD.Fi.gro
  	gmx grompp -f minim.mdp -c SOD.Fi.gro -p SOD.Fi.top
 	gmx mdrun -v -deffnm topol
