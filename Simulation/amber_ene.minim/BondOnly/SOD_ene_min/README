For this simulation:
# Dihedral is turn off by changing lines 234 and 237 of the forcefield file (by setting dihedral force constant equals 0)
# Pseudo is turn off by changing the first line of pseudo.inp to set force constant equal 0
# triple is turn off by changing the first line of triple.inp to set force constant equal 0
