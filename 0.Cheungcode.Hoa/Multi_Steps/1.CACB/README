OBJECTIVE:
In this directory you calculate the C_alpha and C_beta coordinate starting 
from a pdb file. You also create and index file for all your coarse-grained
sites. 
__________________________________________________________________________

STEPS:

1) run step1.csh

	./step1.csh pdb name

pdb: is the pdb file for the protein 
name: is any name you prefer for all the files used

example: ./step1.csh 1CFD.pdb cfd

2) copy the new PDB and NUM files to 2.HB and 3.SC directories 

__________________________________________________________________________

NOTES:

1) The input files:

	pdb file

2) The needed scripts and other files:

	a) c code

		beta_coor.c						  : calculates the cbeta coordinate
	        format.c						  : formats the crd file

	b) shell scripts 
		
		step1.csh						  : the main script

	c) perl scripts

		removeH_OT.pl 						  : removes Hydrogen and OT atoms from the original pdb file
	        numbers.pl						  : calculates NATOM and NTYPE for use in header files

	d) header file

		IOab.header (template, will be updated in step1.csh)  	  : header file

3) The output files:

	PDB								  : pdb file with no Hydrogen or OT's
	NUM								  : file that has the natom and ntype
	NATIVE								  : crd file of the native state
	ATOM								  : atom index file

4) The script "step1.csh" has more comments.
