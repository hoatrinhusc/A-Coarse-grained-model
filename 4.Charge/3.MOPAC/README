* cp ../2.Minimization/min.pdb .
* cp min.pdb m2.mop
* Delete all the lines before ATOM and add the following lines:mozyme geo-ok residues 1scf eps=78.4
* sbatch mopac.batch
* when mopac is done, you will get "m2.out".
* Extract all the lines of "m2.out" which are between the 2 lines:
 ATOM NO.                 TYPE                        CHARGE      No. of ELECS.   s-Pop       p-Pop       d-Pop
.....................................(extract)................................................................
 NET CHARGE ON RESIDUES

* Then, you should get something which is formatted similarly to the file which I called MopacCharge.
  The name of your file should be "MopacCharge" also.

* The total charge calculated by mopac is -2.
