#DESCRIPTION
In this folder you will generate charge for CAs and CBs beads by using the script "charge.py". 
Script "table.c" is to generate the tabulated potential for Debye-Huckel potential.
The 2 scripts are independent. Hence, which script to be excuted first is not important.

#NEED:
1. Input: MopacCharge
2. Script: charge.py, table.c
3. Output: CACB.charge

#USAGE:
python charge.py
gcc table.c -o table -lm
./table

#TOPOLOGY:
After getting CACB.charge, you add it to "SOD.top" (which is obtained from step 2.Topology) to get "SOD.charge.top".
Or you add it to "SOD.Fi.top" (which is obtained from step 4.Crowders) to get "SOD.Fi.charge.top". 
Diff the files to see how I added "CACB.charge" to "SOD.top".

#Running Gromacs with tabulate potential
gmx grompp -f minim.mdp -c CI2.gro -p CI2.top -o ci2.tpr
 gmx mdrun -v -deffnm ci2 -table table_Debye.xvg -tablep table_Debye.xvg
